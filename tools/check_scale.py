"""Quick smoke test for the scale service.

It initialises :class:`ScaleService` using the same safe factory employed by the
UI, starts the worker thread and prints a handful of readings.  The script never
raises even when the hardware is not connected which makes it suitable for
diagnostics from SSH sessions.
